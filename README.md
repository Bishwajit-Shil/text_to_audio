# Text-to-Speech Conversion with gTTS

This script converts text to speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library and plays the audio.

## Installation

Before running the script, you need to install the gTTS library. You can install it via pip:

```
pip install gtts
```

## Usage

1. Import the required module for text-to-speech conversion (`gTTS`) and the `os` module for playing audio.
2. Open a text file containing the text you want to convert.
3. Read the text from the file.
4. Specify the language for conversion (e.g., `'en'` for English).
5. Create a gTTS object with the text and language, optionally setting `slow=False` for faster speech.
6. Save the converted audio as an MP3 file.
7. Play the converted audio.

## Example

```python
# Import the required module for text-to-speech conversion
from gtts import gTTS

# This module is imported so that we can play the converted audio
import os

# Open the text file
file = open('result.text', 'r')
text = file.read()

# The language in which you want to convert
language = 'en'

# Passing the text and language to the engine
myobj = gTTS(text=text, lang=language, slow=False)

# Saving the converted audio in an MP3 file
myobj.save("welcome.mp3")

# Playing the converted file
os.system("mpg321 welcome.mp3")
```

Make sure to replace `'result.text'` with the path to your text file.

# OCR Text Recognition

This script performs optical character recognition (OCR) on images and converts the recognized text to speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library.

## Installation

Before running the script, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them via pip:

```
pip install pytesseract pillow opencv-python-headless numpy gtts
```

## Usage

1. Import the required modules for OCR (`pytesseract`, `PIL`, `cv2`, `numpy`) and text-to-speech conversion (`gTTS`, `os`).
2. Define the `texts` function to perform OCR on an image and return the recognized text.
3. Read an image file or capture frames from a video stream.
4. Perform OCR on the image to extract text.
5. Display the original image and a text overlay showing the recognized text.
6. Write the recognized text to a file when pressing the 's' key.
7. Convert the written text to speech and save it as an MP3 file when the 'q' key is pressed.

## Example

```python
# Your script here...
```

Make sure to replace the image file path `'love.png'` with the path to your image file.
